# GiphyGameSearch


Pseudocode:

1. When the html page is loaded, the buttons from my game array are populated.
2. When clicking any of the populated buttons, it takes to Gihpy API and shows the giphs related to the food button I click.
3. The limit of the giphs comes from the API is 10.
4. When I click on any of the image, it moves.
5. When I click back on the image, it stops.
6. Clicking back to the still image makes the giph move again.
7. I can add a new food button to the intial populated buttons on the page by typing in the text box and clicking on the submit button.
8. The new button gets added to the array and loops through.
9. By clicking the newly added button from the user also brings down 10 giphs from the server as others already populated buttons from my array, and reponds the same (When clicking on the image, it moves, clicking back makes the image stop and again clicking back the image will make it move again)
